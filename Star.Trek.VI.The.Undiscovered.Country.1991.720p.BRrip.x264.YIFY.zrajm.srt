Captain's Log, U.S.S. Excelsior.

5
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:42,597
Hikaru Sulu commanding.

6
00:03:43,515 --> 00:03:44,640
After three years,

7
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:48,060
I've concluded my first assignment
as master of this vessel,

8
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:51,981
cataloguing gaseous planetary
anomalies in Beta Quadrant.

9
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:57,194
We're heading home
under full impulse power.

10
00:03:57,279 --> 00:04:00,239
I am pleased to report
that ship and crew have functioned well.

11
00:04:00,324 --> 00:04:04,493
According to this, we've completed
our survey of the entire sector.

12
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:19,091
I have an energy wave
at 240 degrees mark 6 port, sir.

13
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:20,343
Visual.

14
00:04:22,304 --> 00:04:24,805
My God.

15
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:30,227
Shields. Shields!

16
00:04:40,906 --> 00:04:42,365
She's not answering her helm.

17
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:44,617
Starboard thruster.
Turn her into the wave.

18
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:45,743
Aye.

19
00:04:49,581 --> 00:04:51,123
Quarter impulse power.

20
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:01,133
Damage report.

21
00:05:01,218 --> 00:05:02,426
Checking all systems, Captain.

22
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:10,810
Don't tell me
that was any meteor shower.

23
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:12,103
Negative, sir.

24
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:16,941
The subspace shockwave
originated at bearing 3-2-3 mark 75.

25
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:18,401
Location...

26
00:05:19,403 --> 00:05:21,404
It's Praxis, sir. It's a Klingon moon.

27
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:24,740
Praxis is their key
energy production facility.

28
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:29,370
Send to Klingon High Command.

29
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:32,289
"This is Excelsior,
a Federation starship.

30
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:36,002
"We have monitored
a large explosion in your sector.

31
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:38,254
"Do you require assistance?"

32
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:41,173
- Aye, sir.
- Mr. Valtane, any more data?

33
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:43,968
Yes, sir. I've confirmed
the location of Praxis, but...

34
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:45,261
What is it?

35
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:48,347
I cannot confirm the existence of Praxis.

36
00:05:48,432 --> 00:05:49,724
Onscreen.

37
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:52,184
Magnify.

38
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:53,811
Computer enhancement.

39
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:59,358
- Praxis?
- What's left of it, sir.

40
00:05:59,443 --> 00:06:01,861
Captain,
I'm getting a message from Praxis.

41
00:06:01,945 --> 00:06:03,446
Let's have it.

42
00:06:08,648 --> 00:06:12,074
(This is an emergency! We have suffered -)
??? {ghoQaH... [...]}
«Help us! [...]»

43
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:20,296
This is Brigadier Kerla
speaking for the High Command.

44
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,924
There has been an incident on Praxis.

45
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:29,472
However, everything is under control.
We have no need for assistance.

46
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:35,561
Obey treaty stipulations
and remain outside the neutral zone.

47
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:38,856
This transmission ends now.

48
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:42,735
"An incident"?

49
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:45,946
- Do we report this, sir?
- Are you kidding?

50
00:06:53,455 --> 00:06:55,206
What are we doing here?

51
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:57,249
Maybe they're throwing us
a retirement party.

52
00:06:57,334 --> 00:07:00,419
- That suits me. I just bought a boat.
- This had better be good.

53
00:07:00,504 --> 00:07:03,380
I'm supposed to be chairing a seminar
at the Academy.

54
00:07:03,465 --> 00:07:05,925
Captain, isn't this just for top brass?

55
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:07,593
If we're all here, where's Sulu?

56
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:11,138
Captain Sulu. On assignment.
Where's Spock?

57
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:24,485
This briefing is classified.
Ladies and gentlemen, the CinC.

58
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:32,201
As you were.

59
00:07:35,831 --> 00:07:38,582
To break this information down
succinctly,

60
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:42,378
the Klingon Empire
has roughly 50 years of life left to it.

61
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:46,298
For full details,
I'm turning this briefing over

62
00:07:46,383 --> 00:07:48,759
to the Federation's special envoy.

63
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:02,815
Good morning.

64
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:06,652
Two months ago, a Federation starship
monitored an explosion

65
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:08,821
on the Klingon moon Praxis.

66
00:08:09,531 --> 00:08:11,615
We believe it was caused
by over-mining

67
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:14,493
and insufficient safety precautions.

68
00:08:14,578 --> 00:08:18,581
The moon's decimation means
the deadly pollution of their ozone.

69
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:20,791
They will have depleted
their supply of oxygen

70
00:08:20,876 --> 00:08:23,460
in approximately 50 Earth years.

71
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:26,672
Due to their enormous military budget,

72
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:28,674
the Klingon economy does not have
the resources

73
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:31,427
with which to combat this catastrophe.

74
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:36,348
Last month, at the behest
of the Vulcan ambassador,

75
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:41,812
I opened a dialogue with Gorkon,
Chancellor of the Klingon High Council.

76
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:45,983
He proposes to commence negotiations
at once.

77
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:48,360
Negotiations for what?

78
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:53,365
The dismantling of our space stations
and starbases along the neutral zone,

79
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:56,702
an end to almost 70 years
of unremitting hostility,

80
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:59,830
which the Klingons can no longer afford.

81
00:09:00,457 --> 00:09:04,001
Bill, are we talking
about mothballing the Starfleet?

82
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:07,463
Well, I'm sure that our exploration
and scientific programs

83
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:10,799
- would be unaffected, Captain, but...
- I must protest.

84
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:15,221
To offer Klingons safe haven
within Federation space is suicide.

85
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:18,557
Klingons would become
the alien trash of the galaxy,

86
00:09:18,642 --> 00:09:20,267
and if we dismantle the fleet,

87
00:09:20,352 --> 00:09:22,978
we'd be defenseless
before an aggressive species

88
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:25,064
with a foothold on our territory.

89
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:28,567
The opportunity here
is to bring them to their knees.

90
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:33,489
Then we'll be in a far better position
to dictate terms.

91
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:35,282
Sir?

92
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:37,701
Captain Kirk.

93
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:40,537
The Klingons
have never been trustworthy.

94
00:09:41,665 --> 00:09:43,916
I'm forced to agree
with Admiral Cartwright.

95
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,001
This is a terrifying idea.

96
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:50,339
It is imperative that we act now
to support the Gorkon initiative

97
00:09:50,674 --> 00:09:53,467
lest more conservative elements
persuade his empire

98
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:57,638
that it is better to attempt
a military solution and die fighting.

99
00:09:57,806 --> 00:10:01,141
You, Captain Kirk,
are to be our first olive branch.

100
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:05,229
We have volunteered to rendezvous
with the Klingon vessel

101
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:07,606
which is bringing Chancellor Gorkon
to Earth

102
00:10:07,691 --> 00:10:11,068
and to escort him safely
through Federation space.

103
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:12,152
Me?

104
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:15,489
Well, there are Klingons who feel
the same way about the peace treaty

105
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:18,075
as yourself and Admiral Cartwright,

106
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:22,746
but they'll think twice about attacking
the Enterprise under your command.

107
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:26,500
I have personally vouched for you
in this matter, Captain.

108
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:30,045
You have personally vouched?

109
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:35,759
You will extend Chancellor Gorkon
full diplomatic courtesy, Captain Kirk.

110
00:10:35,844 --> 00:10:37,720
But a full ambassador
would be better equipped...

111
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:40,055
If there's no further business,

112
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,601
I wish you and your crew Godspeed.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

113
00:10:44,686 --> 00:10:47,396
I remind you, this meeting is classified.

114
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:57,239
I don't know whether
to congratulate you or not, Jim.

115
00:10:58,533 --> 00:10:59,908
I wouldn't.

116
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:05,497
We volunteered?

117
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:11,462
There is an old Vulcan proverb,
"Only Nixon could go to China."

118
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:14,381
How could you vouch for me?

119
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:17,926
That's arrogant presumption.

120
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:20,179
My father requested
that I open negotiations...

121
00:11:20,263 --> 00:11:23,140
I know your father's the Vulcan
ambassador, for heaven's sake,

122
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:25,684
but you know how I feel about this.

123
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:28,395
They're animals.

124
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,775
Jim, there is an historic opportunity
here.

125
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:35,527
Don't believe them. Don't trust them.

126
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:38,614
- They are dying.
- Let them die.

127
00:11:41,785 --> 00:11:47,206
Has it occurred to you that this crew
is due to stand down in three months?

128
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:50,209
We've done our bit for king and country.

129
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:52,920
You should have trusted me.

130
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:02,888
Control, this is SD-103,
approach to spacedock. Over.

131
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:06,558
SD-103, you are clear
to deliver Captain Kirk and party

132
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:10,312
to NCC-1701 Alpha. Over.

133
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:17,027
Captain on the Bridge.

134
00:12:17,112 --> 00:12:20,197
- As you were, Lieutenant...
- Valeris, sir.

135
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,409
We were told that you needed
a helmsman, so I volunteered.

136
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:26,662
Lieutenant, it is agreeable
to see you again.

137
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:29,748
Lieutenant was the first Vulcan
to be graduated

138
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:33,669
- at the top of her class at the academy.
- You must be very proud.

139
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,254
I don't believe so, sir.

140
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:37,381
She's a Vulcan, all right.

141
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:40,342
Let's get this over with.
Departure stations.

142
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:42,594
- Scotty.
- Aye, sir?

143
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:43,929
Did you find the engine room?

144
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:45,431
Right where I left it, sir.

145
00:12:45,515 --> 00:12:48,475
Standby. Uhura, get me the dockmaster.

146
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,769
Control tower reading, sir.

147
00:12:50,854 --> 00:12:55,232
Control, this is Enterprise
requesting permission to depart.

148
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:58,861
This is Control, Enterprise.
Permission to depart granted.

149
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:00,529
Thirty seconds for port gates.

150
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:02,239
Clear all moorings.

151
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:04,867
Awaiting port gates from this mark.

152
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:06,368
All moorings clear.

153
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:08,120
Aft thrusters.

154
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:10,914
Thank you, Lieutenant.
One-quarter impulse power.

155
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:14,960
Captain, may I remind you
that regulations specify thrusters

156
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:17,045
only while in spacedock?

157
00:13:21,384 --> 00:13:22,676
Jim?

158
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:27,556
You heard the order, Lieutenant.

159
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:29,725
Aye, sir.

160
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:06,512
Captain's Log, Stardate 9522.6.

161
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:10,933
I've never trusted Klingons,
and I never will.

162
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:18,899
I could never forgive them
for the death of my boy.

163
00:14:20,944 --> 00:14:23,987
It seems to me our mission
to escort the Chancellor

164
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:27,616
of the Klingon High Council
to a peace summit

165
00:14:28,451 --> 00:14:30,452
is problematic at best.

166
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:36,625
Spock says this could be
an historic occasion,

167
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:38,835
and I'd like to believe him,

168
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:43,131
but how on earth can history
get past people like me?

169
00:14:45,927 --> 00:14:47,094
Sorry.

170
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:49,388
You could have knocked.

171
00:14:49,472 --> 00:14:53,433
We are almost at the rendezvous, sir.
I thought that you would like to know.

172
00:14:53,518 --> 00:14:54,685
Right.

173
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:03,193
Permission to speak freely, sir.
It is an honor to serve with you.

174
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:12,494
You piloted well
out of spacedock, Lieutenant.

175
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:15,289
I've always wanted to try that, sir.

176
00:15:25,675 --> 00:15:27,676
You've done well, Valeris.

177
00:15:28,011 --> 00:15:31,597
As your sponsor at the academy,

178
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:34,474
I have followed your career
with satisfaction,

179
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:38,854
and as a Vulcan,
you've exceeded my expectations.

180
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:43,358
I do not understand this representation.

181
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,404
It is a depiction
from ancient Earth mythology,

182
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:50,324
the expulsion from Paradise.

183
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:52,993
Why keep it in your quarters?

184
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,955
It is a reminder to me
that all things end.

185
00:16:01,753 --> 00:16:05,005
It is of endings that I wish to speak.

186
00:16:07,717 --> 00:16:10,844
Sir, I address you as a kindred intellect.

187
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:14,014
Do you not recognize

188
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:19,394
that a turning point has been reached
in the affairs of the Federation?

189
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:25,067
History is replete
with turning points, Lieutenant.

190
00:16:25,276 --> 00:16:28,236
- You must have faith.
- Faith?

191
00:16:28,738 --> 00:16:31,573
That the universe
will unfold as it should.

192
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:36,578
- But is that logical? Surely we must...
- Logic, logic and logic.

193
00:16:38,373 --> 00:16:42,584
Logic is the beginning
of wisdom, Valeris,

194
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,378
not the end.

195
00:16:46,798 --> 00:16:51,218
This will be my final voyage onboard
this vessel as a member of her crew.

196
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:56,848
Nature abhors a vacuum.

197
00:16:58,601 --> 00:17:00,686
I intend you to replace me.

198
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:11,947
I could only succeed you, sir.

199
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:20,038
Now hear this. All officers to the Bridge.

200
00:17:20,123 --> 00:17:22,374
Klingon battle cruiser off the port bow.

201
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:24,334
All officers to the Bridge.

202
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,853
Captain on the Bridge.

203
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,661
Shall we raise our shields, Captain?

204
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:03,123
Never been this close.

205
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:08,837
The Chancellor is undoubtedly awaiting
our signal.

206
00:18:17,972 --> 00:18:20,849
- Uhura, hailing frequencies.
- Aye, sir.

207
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,769
Right standard rudder.
Bring us alongside.

208
00:18:23,853 --> 00:18:26,605
Right standard rudder.
Z plus 5 degrees.

209
00:18:26,856 --> 00:18:28,857
Channel is open, Captain.

210
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:31,568
This is the Starship Enterprise,

211
00:18:31,694 --> 00:18:34,029
Captain James T. Kirk commanding.

212
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:36,865
This is Kronos One.

213
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:40,035
I am Chancellor Gorkon.

214
00:18:44,707 --> 00:18:46,958
Chancellor, we've been ordered
to escort you

215
00:18:47,043 --> 00:18:50,128
through Federation space
to your meeting on Earth.

216
00:18:50,213 --> 00:18:51,922
Thank you, Captain.

217
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:55,300
Would you and your party
care to dine this evening

218
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:57,636
aboard the Enterprise with my officers,

219
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,722
as guests
of the United Federation of Planets?

220
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:04,726
We would be delighted to accept
your gracious invitation.

221
00:19:08,022 --> 00:19:11,817
We'll make arrangements to have you
beamed aboard at 1930 hours.

222
00:19:11,901 --> 00:19:14,110
I shall look forward to that.

223
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:23,912
- Well, I hope you're happy.
- Captain,

224
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:27,415
there is a supply
of Romulan ale aboard.

225
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,544
It might make the evening
pass more smoothly.

226
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:33,463
Officer thinking, Lieutenant.

227
00:19:36,092 --> 00:19:38,218
Guess who's coming to dinner.

228
00:19:49,856 --> 00:19:51,106
Energize.

229
00:20:25,433 --> 00:20:27,642
- Chancellor Gorkon.
- Captain Kirk.

230
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:30,896
May I present Captain Spock,
whom I believe you know.

231
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:33,481
Captain, face to face at last.

232
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:37,152
- You have my thanks.
- Chancellor.

233
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:41,323
Gentlemen,

234
00:20:42,325 --> 00:20:44,743
this is my daughter Azetbur,

235
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:51,499
my military adviser, Brigadier Kerla,

236
00:20:53,628 --> 00:20:57,213
and this is General Chang,
my chief of staff.

237
00:20:58,049 --> 00:21:01,051
I have so wanted to meet you, Captain.

238
00:21:02,345 --> 00:21:04,512
I'm not sure how to take that.

239
00:21:05,056 --> 00:21:07,974
Sincere admiration, Kirk.

240
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:11,061
From one warrior to another.

241
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,147
Right.

242
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:20,987
This way.
I think you might enjoy a brief tour.

243
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:41,549
- They all look alike.
- What about that smell?

244
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:45,011
You know only top-of-the-line models
can even talk...

245
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:51,643
You men have work?

246
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:53,228
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

247
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:54,896
Then snap to it.

248
00:22:35,104 --> 00:22:36,771
I offer a toast.

249
00:22:37,732 --> 00:22:39,774
"The undiscover'd country,"

250
00:22:43,404 --> 00:22:44,654
the future.

251
00:22:44,739 --> 00:22:46,698
- "The undiscover'd country."
- "The undiscover'd country."

252
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:49,242
Hamlet, Act III, Scene 1.

253
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:50,994
You've not experienced Shakespeare

254
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:53,705
until you have read him
in the original Klingon.

255
00:22:55,485 --> 00:22:59,029
{taH pagh taHbe'.}
«"To be or not to be."»

256
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:08,344
Captain Kirk,
I thought Romulan ale was illegal.

257
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:10,847
One of the advantages
of being 1,000 light-years

258
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:12,849
from Federation Headquarters.

259
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:17,479
To you, Chancellor Gorkon,
one of the architects of our future.

260
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:19,355
- Chancellor.
- Chancellor.

261
00:23:19,405 --> 00:23:20,466
{vavoy.}
«Father.»

262
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:25,236
Perhaps we are looking
at something of that future here.

263
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:29,741
Tell me, Captain Kirk,

264
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:34,329
would you be willing
to give up Starfleet?

265
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:43,588
I believe the Captain feels
that Starfleet's mission

266
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:45,882
has always been one of peace.

267
00:23:48,886 --> 00:23:50,970
Far be it for me
to dispute my first officer,

268
00:23:51,055 --> 00:23:52,722
but Starfleet has always been
at the fore...

269
00:23:52,807 --> 00:23:54,974
Captain, there's no need
to mince words.

270
00:23:55,059 --> 00:23:58,144
In space, all warriors are cold warriors.

271
00:24:00,523 --> 00:24:03,108
General, are you fond of

272
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:05,360
Shakespeare?

273
00:24:06,487 --> 00:24:09,614
We do believe all planets
have a sovereign claim

274
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:11,449
to inalienable human rights.

275
00:24:11,534 --> 00:24:15,537
Inalien?
If you could only hear yourselves.

276
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:18,331
"Human rights."

277
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:21,209
Why, the very name is racist.

278
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:26,381
The Federation is no more
than a "Homo Sapiens Only" club.

279
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:29,384
Present company excepted, of course.

280
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:32,762
In any case,
we know where this is leading.

281
00:24:33,222 --> 00:24:36,474
- The annihilation of our culture.
- That's not true.

282
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:37,851
- No?
- No.

283
00:24:38,853 --> 00:24:40,687
"To be, or not to be."

284
00:24:40,771 --> 00:24:44,732
That is the question which preoccupies
our people, Captain Kirk.

285
00:24:44,817 --> 00:24:48,319
- We need breathing room.
- Earth, Hitler, 1938.

286
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:51,906
I beg your pardon?

287
00:24:56,078 --> 00:24:57,287
Well...

288
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:03,084
I see we have a long way to go.

289
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:06,254
We must do this again sometime.

290
00:25:10,843 --> 00:25:13,261
You don't trust me, do you?

291
00:25:14,597 --> 00:25:16,264
I don't blame you.

292
00:25:17,808 --> 00:25:20,685
If there is to be a brave new world,

293
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:24,772
our generation is going
to have the hardest time living in it.

294
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:30,820
Captain Spock.

295
00:25:31,322 --> 00:25:32,697
Chancellor.

296
00:25:33,282 --> 00:25:35,742
- Madam.
- Captain.

297
00:25:36,285 --> 00:25:38,119
Well, most kind.

298
00:25:39,163 --> 00:25:43,833
"Parting is such sweet sorrow," Captain.

299
00:25:45,461 --> 00:25:48,880
Have we not
"heard the chimes at midnight"?

300
00:25:59,206 --> 00:26:00,306
{DaH machegh.}
«We are returning now.»

301
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:14,364
Thank God.

302
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:18,117
Did you see the way they ate?

303
00:26:19,036 --> 00:26:21,079
Terrible table manners.

304
00:26:21,789 --> 00:26:23,581
I doubt that our own behavior

305
00:26:23,666 --> 00:26:26,167
will distinguish us
in the annals of diplomacy.

306
00:26:26,252 --> 00:26:27,961
I'm going to sleep this off.

307
00:26:28,045 --> 00:26:30,964
Please let me know if there's some
other way we can screw up tonight.

308
00:26:31,048 --> 00:26:33,883
I'm going to go find
a pot of black coffee.

309
00:26:49,525 --> 00:26:53,111
The Enterprise hosted
Chancellor Gorkon and company

310
00:26:53,195 --> 00:26:55,029
to dinner last night.

311
00:26:56,198 --> 00:26:59,867
Our manners weren't exactly
Emily Post.

312
00:27:01,078 --> 00:27:02,120
Note to the galley,

313
00:27:02,204 --> 00:27:05,873
Romulan ale no longer to be served
at diplomatic functions.

314
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:12,338
Captain Kirk, will you please
join me on the Bridge?

315
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:14,173
Captain Kirk?

316
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:22,557
- Captain.
- What is it?

317
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:24,392
I find this curious.

318
00:27:24,518 --> 00:27:25,643
Spock, I'm really tired.

319
00:27:25,728 --> 00:27:29,188
We are reading an enormous amount
of neutron radiation.

320
00:27:30,733 --> 00:27:31,774
Where?

321
00:27:31,859 --> 00:27:35,069
Strangely enough,
it appears to be emanating from us.

322
00:27:35,154 --> 00:27:36,696
The Enterprise?

323
00:27:39,116 --> 00:27:42,452
Valeris, do you know anything
about a radiation surge?

324
00:27:42,953 --> 00:27:44,037
Sir?

325
00:27:44,246 --> 00:27:45,204
Chekov?

326
00:27:45,289 --> 00:27:47,915
Only the size of my head.

327
00:27:48,334 --> 00:27:50,001
I know what you mean.

328
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:08,770
- What's happened?
- We have fired on the Chancellor's ship.

329
00:28:08,854 --> 00:28:10,855
Torpedo Room, please confirm.

330
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:12,315
Have we fired?

331
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:13,608
...0-6...

332
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:15,943
- Uhura, monitor.
- Aye, sir.

333
00:28:16,028 --> 00:28:17,403
Direct hit.

334
00:28:18,364 --> 00:28:19,906
Confirmed, sir.

335
00:28:25,478 --> 00:28:27,178

We are betrayed!
{nutojbej!}
«They have definitely tricked us!»

345
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:52,772
This is the Bridge. Do you read?
Do you read?

346
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:54,899
Torpedo bay,
did we fire those torpedoes?

347
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:57,360
Negative, Captain.
According to inventory,

348
00:28:57,444 --> 00:28:59,070
we're still fully loaded.

349
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,741
{yotwI'!}
«Intruder!»

350
00:29:17,714 --> 00:29:20,425
Find Chang.
{cheng'e' DaH Sam!}
«Find Chang now!»

351
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,375
FIXME: I hear something like {HoSghey}
or {toSghey}

352
00:29:27,391 --> 00:29:30,268
Unable to confirm or deny
firing of two photon torpedoes.

353
00:29:30,352 --> 00:29:32,645
- Hailing frequencies.
- Aye, sir.

354
00:29:33,522 --> 00:29:37,775
Kronos One, this is Enterprise.
Do you read? Over.

355
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:40,695
Repeat. Kronos One...

356
00:29:52,869 --> 00:29:54,069
{SoH 'Iv jay'?!}
«Who the hell are you?!»
FIXME sounds more like {HolI' wo'} or sm.th.

357
00:29:55,742 --> 00:29:56,842
{SoH 'Iv jay'?!}
«Who the hell are you?!»
FIXME sounds more like {HolI' wo'} or sm.th.

358
00:29:57,092 --> 00:29:58,848
{ghoQaH!}
«Help us!»
FIXME: sound like «goquah»

359
00:30:11,857 --> 00:30:13,757
{qaStaH nuq jay'?}
«What the hell is happening?»

360
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,885
It's very hard to make out, Captain.

361
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:49,430
There's been some weapons firing
and a lot of shouting.

362
00:30:49,515 --> 00:30:50,848
She is still listing.

363
00:30:50,933 --> 00:30:53,184
She's spinning out of control.

364
00:31:11,454 --> 00:31:16,207
Restoring auxiliary gravity.
{Duj tlham chu'qa'.}
«Re-enabling vessel gravity.»

365
00:31:26,969 --> 00:31:30,221
Have you not a shred
of decency in you, Kirk?

366
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:35,184
We come in peace,
and you blatantly defile that peace.

367
00:31:36,562 --> 00:31:39,480
For that,
I shall blow you out of the stars.

368
00:31:42,276 --> 00:31:44,819
- We haven't fired.
- Captain.

369
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:49,699
According to our databanks,
we have, twice.

370
00:31:50,117 --> 00:31:52,326
Captain, they're coming about.

371
00:31:59,001 --> 00:32:02,086
- They're preparing to fire.
- Shields up, Captain?

372
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:05,464
- Captain, our shields.
- Shields up, Captain?

373
00:32:07,593 --> 00:32:10,177
- Signal our surrender.
- Captain?

374
00:32:10,262 --> 00:32:11,721
We surrender!

375
00:32:13,098 --> 00:32:15,308
- This is Enterprise. We surrender.
- If they fire at us

376
00:32:15,392 --> 00:32:16,851
- with our shields down...
- I repeat.

377
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:19,103
- We surrender.
- ...we will not be able to respond.

378
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:21,397
Repeat. Enterprise surrenders.

379
00:32:25,527 --> 00:32:27,403
- Are we firing torpedoes?
- I wish I knew.

380
00:32:28,113 --> 00:32:29,864
Well, it sure looks like it.

381
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:31,616
I'm going aboard.
Spock, you have the conn.

382
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:34,118
I am responsible
for involving you in this. I will go.

383
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:36,621
No, I'll go. You'll be responsible
for getting me out of this.

384
00:32:36,705 --> 00:32:38,789
We'll not be the instigators
of full-scale war

385
00:32:38,874 --> 00:32:40,583
on the eve of universal peace.

386
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:42,501
I'm going, too. They may need a doctor.

387
00:32:42,586 --> 00:32:44,837
- Perhaps you're right.
- Uhura, tell them we're coming,

388
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:46,631
and tell them we're unarmed.

389
00:32:46,715 --> 00:32:47,965
Aye, sir.

390
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:55,097
Have you lost your mind?

391
00:32:55,182 --> 00:32:56,932
I give you my word,
I don't understand what has happened.

392
00:32:57,017 --> 00:32:58,684
We're here to help.

393
00:33:00,562 --> 00:33:01,937
Follow me.

394
00:33:05,237 --> 00:33:07,370
{ropyaH yIghuHmoH!}
«Alert sick bay!»

??? {maqtu' yoH}

403
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:30,424
- Chancellor Gorkon.
- My God.

404
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:34,679
- What has happened here?
- You dare to feign ignorance?

405
00:33:34,763 --> 00:33:37,848
- What happened?
- With a direct torpedo hit,

406
00:33:37,933 --> 00:33:40,643
you crippled
our entire gravitational field,

407
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:44,814
and two of your Starfleet crew
beamed aboard wearing magnetic boots

408
00:33:44,898 --> 00:33:45,898
and did this.

409
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:47,566
Aren't you carrying a surgeon?

410
00:33:47,651 --> 00:33:49,360
We were until this disgrace.

411
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:52,279
Well, then for God sakes, man,
let me help.

412
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:05,334
I've got a pulse. We can move him.

413
00:34:05,419 --> 00:34:08,838
I'm gonna need some light.
Can we get him up on this table?

414
00:34:11,588 --> 00:34:12,544
{yIwoH.}
«Pick him up.»

415
00:34:12,894 --> 00:34:14,677
??? {yI‹Hot›be'.}
«Don't touch him.»

416
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:20,349
Hold him. Hold him while I stabilize him.

417
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:28,816
I said hold him.

418
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:34,613
Sweet Jesus.

419
00:34:35,282 --> 00:34:38,325
- Can you...
- Jim, I don't even know his anatomy.

420
00:34:42,706 --> 00:34:45,833
- His wounds are not closing.
- He's killing him!

421
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:53,924
He's gone into
some kind of damned arrest.

422
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:01,307
Come on, damn it! Come on!

423
00:35:05,562 --> 00:35:07,354
He's not responding.

424
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:30,127
Don't let it end this way, Captain.

425
00:36:06,456 --> 00:36:11,126
Under article number 184
of your interstellar law,

426
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:15,130
I'm placing you under arrest.

427
00:36:15,215 --> 00:36:20,845
You are charged with assassinating
our Chancellor of the High Council.

428
00:36:20,929 --> 00:36:22,721
He tried to save him.

429
00:36:24,071 --> 00:36:25,408
{HItlhej!}
«Come with me!»

430
00:36:29,646 --> 00:36:31,564
They've been arrested.

431
00:36:32,983 --> 00:36:35,609
Mr. Spock, we've got to do something.

432
00:36:37,112 --> 00:36:40,447
I assume command of this ship
as of 0230 hours.

433
00:36:40,532 --> 00:36:43,534
Commander Uhura,
please notify Starfleet Headquarters.

434
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:45,035
Tell them precisely
what has taken place

435
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,829
- and request instructions.
- Aye, sir.

436
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:49,498
We cannot allow them to be taken back
to Kronos as prisoners.

437
00:36:49,583 --> 00:36:53,168
What do you suggest, Lieutenant?
Opening fire will not retrieve them,

438
00:36:53,253 --> 00:36:56,338
and an armed conflict is precisely
what the Captain wished to avoid.

439
00:36:56,423 --> 00:36:58,591
We will be able to follow
the Captain's movements.

440
00:36:58,675 --> 00:37:02,136
- How did you achieve this, sir?
- Time is precious, Lieutenant.

441
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:05,723
We must endeavor to piece together
what happened here tonight.

442
00:37:05,807 --> 00:37:09,435
According to our databank,
this ship fired those torpedoes.

443
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:10,728
No way.

444
00:37:10,812 --> 00:37:14,356
I sympathize, Mr. Scott,
but we need evidence.

445
00:37:14,441 --> 00:37:16,191
Please accompany me.

446
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:20,654
And if we cannot
piece together what happened?

447
00:37:21,114 --> 00:37:23,866
- What then, sir?
- In that case, Mr. Chekov,

448
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:27,161
it resides in the purview
of the diplomats.

449
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:31,832
The Chancellor of the High Council
is dead!

450
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:37,504
The result of an unprovoked attack
while he travelled to see you

451
00:37:37,589 --> 00:37:40,758
under a flag of truce,
on a mission of peace.

452
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:44,595
Captain Kirk was legally arrested
for the crime.

453
00:37:45,472 --> 00:37:47,598
May I remind you that he and Dr McCoy

454
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:50,726
boarded Kronos One
of their own free will?

455
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:53,562
None of these facts are in dispute,
Mr. President.

456
00:37:53,647 --> 00:37:56,440
I have ordered a full-scale investigation.

457
00:37:56,983 --> 00:37:59,276
- In the meantime...
- In the meantime,

458
00:37:59,361 --> 00:38:03,614
we expect the Federation to abide
by the articles of interstellar law,

459
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:05,699
which you claim to cherish.

460
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:08,786
Kirk and Dr McCoy will stand trial

461
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:11,121
for the assassination
of Chancellor Gorkon.

462
00:38:11,206 --> 00:38:12,957
Out of the question.

463
00:38:13,083 --> 00:38:14,541
Ambassador Sarek,
there must be some way

464
00:38:14,626 --> 00:38:16,418
to extradite these men.

465
00:38:16,503 --> 00:38:21,632
Mr. President, I share a measure
of personal responsibility in this matter,

466
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:23,592
but I am obliged to confirm

467
00:38:23,677 --> 00:38:26,428
my esteemed colleague's
legal interpretation.

468
00:38:26,805 --> 00:38:28,514
What is the position
of the Romulan government,

469
00:38:28,598 --> 00:38:30,140
Ambassador Nanclus?

470
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:33,769
I must concur with my colleagues.

471
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:37,022
But you can't possibly believe
that James Kirk assassinated

472
00:38:37,107 --> 00:38:39,608
the Chancellor of the High Council.

473
00:38:39,693 --> 00:38:43,278
Mr. President,
I don't know what to believe.

474
00:38:44,823 --> 00:38:47,241
I'm waiting for your answer, sir.

475
00:38:49,411 --> 00:38:52,621
This president is not above the law.

476
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:56,542
Report back at once. Do you copy?
At once.

477
00:38:57,127 --> 00:38:59,003
Enterprise to report back on the double.

478
00:38:59,087 --> 00:39:00,504
Do you read? At once.

479
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:02,256
We're to report back at once.

480
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,758
We cannot abandon
Captain Kirk and Dr McCoy.

481
00:39:04,843 --> 00:39:06,343
Of course not.

482
00:39:06,428 --> 00:39:08,846
Four hundred years ago
on the planet Earth,

483
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:12,057
workers who felt their livelihood
threatened by automation

484
00:39:12,142 --> 00:39:17,521
flung their wooden shoes called "sabot"
into the machines to stop them.

485
00:39:19,858 --> 00:39:23,193
Hence the word "sabotage."

486
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:28,615
We are experiencing
technical malfunction.

487
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:31,076
All backup systems inoperative.

488
00:39:31,411 --> 00:39:34,788
Excellent. I mean, too bad.

489
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:37,708
Mr. President,

490
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:40,044
I've been named Chancellor
by the High Council

491
00:39:40,128 --> 00:39:41,920
in my father's place.

492
00:39:42,464 --> 00:39:43,672
Madam Chancellor,

493
00:39:43,757 --> 00:39:46,717
you have my sincerest condolences
on your recent loss.

494
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:49,470
I want to assure you
that this shameful deed will not...

495
00:39:49,554 --> 00:39:52,639
Mr. President, let us come to the point.

496
00:39:53,266 --> 00:39:56,518
You want this conference
to go forward, and so did my father.

497
00:39:56,603 --> 00:40:00,189
I will attend in one week
on one condition.

498
00:40:00,273 --> 00:40:02,566
We will not extradite the prisoners,

499
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:06,904
and you will make no attempt
to rescue them in a military operation.

500
00:40:06,988 --> 00:40:10,741
We would consider any such attempt
an act of war.

501
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:13,077
We hope you'll be our guest
here on Earth.

502
00:40:13,161 --> 00:40:18,207
After recent events, you will understand
if I say I prefer a neutral site,

503
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:23,670
and in the interests of security,
let us keep the location secret for now.

504
00:40:24,506 --> 00:40:26,673
As you wish, Madam Chancellor.

505
00:40:28,502 --> 00:40:31,762
Attack them now, while we still can!
{DIHIvlaHtaHvIS DaH DIHIvnIS!}

506
00:40:32,097 --> 00:40:36,933
Attack or be slaves in their world.
{DIHIvbe'chugh qo'chajDaq toy'wI''a' DImoj.}

507
00:40:38,162 --> 00:40:43,148

«You don't seem to grasp our situation, General.»

509
00:40:48,237 --> 00:40:54,314
War is obsolete, General, as we are in danger of becoming.

00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:06,421
Your father was killed
for what he wanted.

513
00:41:07,966 --> 00:41:10,759
The peace process will go forward.

514
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:14,096
Kirk...

515
00:41:18,059 --> 00:41:22,062
Kirk will pay for my father's death.

516
00:41:25,567 --> 00:41:27,442
- Kirk! Kirk!
- Kirk! Kirk!

517
00:41:28,653 --> 00:41:32,906
- Kirk! Kirk! Kirk! Kirk!
- Kirk! Kirk! Kirk! Kirk!

518
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:38,704
- Kirk! Kirk! Kirk! Kirk!
- Kirk! Kirk! Kirk! Kirk!

519
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:44,626
- Kirk! Kirk! Kirk! Kirk!
- Kirk! Kirk! Kirk! Kirk!

520
00:41:45,628 --> 00:41:50,299
- Kirk! Kirk! Kirk! Kirk!
- Kirk! Kirk! Kirk! Kirk!

521
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:56,680
It's a damn show trial.

522
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:59,433
- Kirk! Kirk!
- Kirk! Kirk!

523
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:07,382
{‹—taH pagh› Qo'noS wa'Daq baHta' ‹DaH wa'noS›}
«‹—taH pagh› ‹DaH wa'noS› fired intentionally at Chronos One.»
(Seqram's speculation: ‹baHpa'› Qo'noS Qo'noS wa'Daq baHta' ['entepray])

524
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:12,029
The Enterprise fired on Kronos One
without provocation.

525
00:42:12,279 --> 00:42:15,779
FIXME: Chang continues to speak, overlap with translator

526
00:42:12,739 --> 00:42:14,740
The Chancellor and his advisers...

527
00:42:14,824 --> 00:42:17,743
...having been lulled
into a false sense of security

528
00:42:17,827 --> 00:42:21,371
by an invitation to a state dinner
aboard Captain Kirk's vessel

529
00:42:21,456 --> 00:42:25,459
at precisely 1930 hours
that same evening.

530
00:42:26,127 --> 00:42:28,128
Call your first witness.

531
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:32,049
After the first shot,
we lost our gravitational field.

532
00:42:32,133 --> 00:42:34,801
I found myself weightless
and unable to function.

533
00:42:34,886 --> 00:42:37,971
Then two Starfleet crewmen
came walking towards me.

534
00:42:38,056 --> 00:42:40,515
But perhaps they merely wore
Starfleet uniforms.

535
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:43,894
That remark is purely speculative.
I move that it be stricken.

536
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:48,148
Colonel Worf,
we are interested in facts, not theories.

537
00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:52,069
If the gravitational unit
was not functioning,

538
00:42:52,153 --> 00:42:54,071
how could these men be walking?

539
00:42:54,155 --> 00:42:56,490
They appeared to be wearing
magnetic boots.

540
00:42:59,035 --> 00:43:00,535
Gravity boots.

541
00:43:01,996 --> 00:43:06,833
Dr McCoy,
would you be so good as to tell me,

542
00:43:07,919 --> 00:43:10,504
what is your current medical status?

543
00:43:12,048 --> 00:43:15,425
Aside from a touch of arthritis,
I'd say pretty good.

544
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:25,018
You have a singular wit, Doctor.

545
00:43:25,812 --> 00:43:29,690
For 27 years, I've been ship surgeon
aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise.

546
00:43:30,149 --> 00:43:32,359
In three months, I stand down.

547
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:39,199
You know, I believe that you consumed

548
00:43:39,284 --> 00:43:43,453
a rather generous amount
of Romulan ale in the officers' mess

549
00:43:43,538 --> 00:43:45,247
on the night in question.
Am I right, Doctor?

550
00:43:45,331 --> 00:43:47,457
- Objection!
- Sustained.

551
00:43:47,542 --> 00:43:50,335
We all did. All of us.

552
00:43:50,545 --> 00:43:55,299
- That doesn't mean...
- Was Chancellor Gorkon alive

553
00:43:55,383 --> 00:43:57,301
when you first examined him?

554
00:43:57,385 --> 00:44:00,137
- Barely.
- Now be careful, Doctor.

555
00:44:00,221 --> 00:44:07,060
Have you ever, in your past,
saved patients as barely alive as he?

556
00:44:07,145 --> 00:44:10,564
I didn't have the medical knowledge
I needed for Klingon anatomy.

557
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:12,941
- I see.
- You were there.

558
00:44:13,943 --> 00:44:16,445
You say you are due for retirement.

559
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:19,364
May I ask, do your hands shake?

560
00:44:19,449 --> 00:44:21,491
- Objection!
- I was nervous.

561
00:44:23,578 --> 00:44:24,578
No.

562
00:44:25,621 --> 00:44:27,414
You were incompetent.

563
00:44:29,584 --> 00:44:31,376
You were incompetent!

564
00:44:31,836 --> 00:44:35,756
Whether deliberately or as a result
of age combined with drink,

565
00:44:36,299 --> 00:44:41,261
- the court will have to determine.
- My God, man! I tried to save him!

566
00:44:42,263 --> 00:44:44,014
I tried to save him.

567
00:44:46,267 --> 00:44:48,352
I was desperate to save him.

568
00:44:50,104 --> 00:44:53,774
He was the last best hope
in the universe for peace.

569
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:56,651
The witness is excused.

570
00:45:00,990 --> 00:45:03,116
There we have it, citizens.

571
00:45:03,201 --> 00:45:06,703
We have finally established
the particulars of the crime,

572
00:45:06,788 --> 00:45:11,458
and now we come to the architect
of this tragic affair,

573
00:45:12,043 --> 00:45:16,963
James Tiberius Kirk.

574
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:22,094
What would
your favorite author say, Captain?

575
00:45:22,804 --> 00:45:23,970
"Let us sit upon the ground

576
00:45:24,055 --> 00:45:26,973
"and tell sad stories
of the death of kings."

577
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:30,143
Tell us your sad story, Kirk.

578
00:45:30,978 --> 00:45:35,107
Tell us that you planned to take revenge
for the death of your son.

579
00:45:36,275 --> 00:45:38,402
- That's not true.
- Objection!

580
00:45:38,486 --> 00:45:41,446
Captain Kirk has not been identified
as the assassin.

581
00:45:41,531 --> 00:45:43,156
Sustained.

582
00:45:43,533 --> 00:45:45,450
I offer into the record

583
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:49,413
this excerpt
from the Captain's personal log.

584
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:54,418
I've never trusted Klingons,
and I never will.

585
00:45:55,962 --> 00:45:59,589
I have never been able to forgive them
for the death of my boy.

586
00:46:03,469 --> 00:46:05,720
Again. Again!
??? {yI‹tlha'›. yI‹tlha'›!}

587
00:46:06,013 --> 00:46:09,349
I've never trusted Klingons,
and I never will.

588
00:46:10,017 --> 00:46:13,937
I have never been able to forgive them
for the death of my boy.

589
00:46:15,114 --> 00:46:16,070
{ghuy'cha'!}
«*@$%»

590
00:46:17,442 --> 00:46:19,234
Are those your words?

591
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:24,865
Those words were spoken by me.

592
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:30,287
Objection!

593
00:46:30,371 --> 00:46:33,123
My client's political views
are not on trial here.

594
00:46:33,207 --> 00:46:36,209
On the contrary!
Captain Kirk's views and motives

595
00:46:36,294 --> 00:46:39,129
are indeed
at the very heart of the matter.

596
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:42,299
This officer's record
shows him to be an insubordinate,

597
00:46:42,383 --> 00:46:45,677
unprincipled,
career-minded opportunist,

598
00:46:45,761 --> 00:46:47,929
with a history of violating
the chain of command

599
00:46:48,014 --> 00:46:49,473
whenever it suited him!

600
00:46:49,557 --> 00:46:50,974
Continue.

601
00:46:51,058 --> 00:46:53,643
Indeed, the record shows
that Captain Kirk

602
00:46:53,728 --> 00:46:55,437
once held the rank of Admiral,

603
00:46:55,521 --> 00:46:58,857
and that Admiral Kirk was broken
for taking matters into his own hands

604
00:46:58,941 --> 00:47:00,567
in defiance of regulations of the law.

605
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:02,444
Do you deny being demoted
for these charges?

606
00:47:02,528 --> 00:47:05,447
Don't wait for the translation!
Answer me now!

607
00:47:05,531 --> 00:47:06,656
I cannot deny it.

608
00:47:06,741 --> 00:47:08,325
- You were demoted?
- Yes.

609
00:47:08,409 --> 00:47:12,746
- For insubordination?
- On occasion, I have disobeyed orders.

610
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:15,874
And were you obeying
or disobeying orders

611
00:47:15,958 --> 00:47:19,044
when you arranged the assassination
of Chancellor Gorkon?

612
00:47:19,128 --> 00:47:21,838
I didn't know about the assassination
until we boarded the ship.

613
00:47:21,923 --> 00:47:24,799
You still deny the Enterprise
fired on Kronos One?

614
00:47:24,884 --> 00:47:26,843
- Well...
- Your Honors, please!

615
00:47:26,928 --> 00:47:30,055
And you still deny your men beamed
aboard and shot the Chancellor?

616
00:47:30,139 --> 00:47:31,264
Objection!

617
00:47:31,349 --> 00:47:33,934
I cannot confirm or deny actions
I did not witness.

618
00:47:34,018 --> 00:47:35,477
Captain Kirk,

619
00:47:36,187 --> 00:47:39,481
are you aware
that as the captain of a starship,

620
00:47:39,565 --> 00:47:43,735
you are required to be responsible
for the actions of your men?

621
00:47:46,364 --> 00:47:47,656
I am.

622
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:50,992
And if it should be proved
that members of your crew

623
00:47:51,077 --> 00:47:54,246
did, in fact,
carry out such an assassination...

624
00:47:54,330 --> 00:47:56,498
Jim, they're setting us up.
Your Honors...

625
00:47:56,582 --> 00:47:57,582
Do not answer!

626
00:47:57,667 --> 00:48:00,961
Captain Kirk,
you will answer the question.

627
00:48:02,311 --> 00:48:03,626
??? {'IHqu'.}

628
00:48:03,561 --> 00:48:04,361
??? {Qapla'.}

629
00:48:04,611 --> 00:48:06,111
FIXME: 2(?) more Klingon lines from the court audience

630
00:48:09,303 --> 00:48:10,428
As captain,

631
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:16,101
I am responsible for the conduct
of the crew under my command.

632
00:48:19,772 --> 00:48:21,940
Your Honors, the State rests.

633
00:48:24,485 --> 00:48:26,361
Send to Commander Enterprise.

634
00:48:27,947 --> 00:48:31,950
"We stand ready to assist you.
Captain Sulu, U.S.S. Excelsior. "

635
00:48:32,785 --> 00:48:39,207
It is the determination of this court
that the prisoners are guilty as charged.

636
00:48:51,178 --> 00:48:52,762
I wish to note for the record

637
00:48:52,847 --> 00:48:56,600
that the evidence against my clients
is entirely circumstantial.

638
00:48:56,684 --> 00:49:00,729
I beg the court to consider this
when pronouncing its sentence.

639
00:49:00,813 --> 00:49:02,439
So noted.

640
00:49:02,523 --> 00:49:06,735
Captain James T. Kirk,
Dr Leonard McCoy,

641
00:49:06,819 --> 00:49:13,116
in the interest of fostering amity
for the forthcoming peace talks,

642
00:49:13,868 --> 00:49:17,370
the sentence of death is commuted.

643
00:49:24,337 --> 00:49:28,131
It is the judgment of this court

644
00:49:29,383 --> 00:49:33,637
that, without possibility of reprieve
or parole,

645
00:49:33,721 --> 00:49:36,640
you be taken from this place

646
00:49:36,724 --> 00:49:43,521
to the dilithium mines
on the penal asteroid of Rura Penthe,

647
00:49:44,231 --> 00:49:48,985
there to spend
the rest of your natural lives.

648
00:49:56,952 --> 00:49:58,703
Rura Penthe?

649
00:50:01,415 --> 00:50:04,959
Known throughout the galaxy
as the aliens' graveyard.

650
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:08,755
Better to kill them now
and get it over with.

651
00:50:30,069 --> 00:50:34,280
Lieutenant, the torpedo hit
once again, please.

652
00:50:39,745 --> 00:50:40,829
Hold.

653
00:50:42,456 --> 00:50:44,332
It is Enterprise.

654
00:50:45,251 --> 00:50:48,336
- We fired.
- That is not possible.

655
00:50:48,713 --> 00:50:52,006
All weapons visually accounted for, sir.

656
00:50:53,551 --> 00:50:57,137
An ancestor of mine maintained
that if you eliminate the impossible,

657
00:50:57,221 --> 00:51:01,182
whatever remains, however improbable,
must be the truth.

658
00:51:01,559 --> 00:51:03,810
What exactly does that mean?

659
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:07,522
It means that if we cannot
have fired those torpedoes,

660
00:51:07,606 --> 00:51:09,149
someone else did.

661
00:51:09,233 --> 00:51:13,361
Well, they did not fire on themselves,
and there were no other ships present.

662
00:51:13,446 --> 00:51:16,072
There was
an enormous neutron energy surge.

663
00:51:16,157 --> 00:51:17,198
Not from us!

664
00:51:17,283 --> 00:51:21,703
A neutron surge that big
could only be produced by another ship.

665
00:51:22,496 --> 00:51:24,038
Kronos One?

666
00:51:24,123 --> 00:51:25,874
Too far away.

667
00:51:25,958 --> 00:51:29,961
Very near us. Possibly beneath us.

668
00:51:30,546 --> 00:51:34,549
If there were a ship beneath us,
the Klingons would have seen her.

669
00:51:37,094 --> 00:51:38,470
Would they?

670
00:51:41,682 --> 00:51:45,185
- A bird-of-prey.
- A bird-of-prey.

671
00:51:48,147 --> 00:51:49,230
Cloaked?

672
00:51:49,315 --> 00:51:52,358
A bird-of-prey cannot fire
when she's cloaked.

673
00:51:52,443 --> 00:51:56,112
All things being equal, Mr. Scott,
I would agree.

674
00:51:56,197 --> 00:51:58,490
However, things are not equal.

675
00:51:59,158 --> 00:52:00,617
This one can.

676
00:52:01,202 --> 00:52:02,660
We must inform Starfleet Command.

677
00:52:02,745 --> 00:52:06,748
Inform them of what,
a new weapon that is invisible?

678
00:52:06,832 --> 00:52:09,125
Raving lunatics,
that's what they'll call us.

679
00:52:09,210 --> 00:52:12,420
They'll say that we're so desperate
to exonerate the Captain

680
00:52:12,505 --> 00:52:14,088
that we'll say anything.

681
00:52:14,173 --> 00:52:17,425
And they would be correct.
We have no evidence,

682
00:52:17,510 --> 00:52:20,553
only a theory
which happens to fit the facts.

683
00:52:20,846 --> 00:52:23,223
Assuming you're right, Mr. Spock,

684
00:52:23,766 --> 00:52:25,892
why would they fire
on their own president?

685
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:27,185
Indeed.

686
00:52:28,062 --> 00:52:29,854
This ship will be searched
from bow to stern.

687
00:52:29,939 --> 00:52:31,481
Lieutenant Valeris, you'll be in charge.

688
00:52:31,565 --> 00:52:33,942
- Aye, sir.
- I do not understand.

689
00:52:34,026 --> 00:52:36,736
If there was a ship underneath us,

690
00:52:36,821 --> 00:52:39,656
surely the assassins
beamed aboard from that vessel,

691
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:41,157
not Enterprise.

692
00:52:41,242 --> 00:52:43,952
You're forgetting something,
Mr. Chekov.

693
00:52:44,703 --> 00:52:48,414
According to our databanks,
this ship fired those torpedoes.

694
00:52:48,916 --> 00:52:51,167
If we did, the killers are here.

695
00:52:51,252 --> 00:52:55,713
If we did not,
whoever altered the databanks is here.

696
00:52:55,965 --> 00:52:59,884
In either case,
what we are looking for is here.

697
00:53:01,095 --> 00:53:03,304
What are we looking for, sir?

698
00:53:04,390 --> 00:53:05,765
Lieutenant?

699
00:53:06,976 --> 00:53:09,102
Two pairs of gravity boots.

700
00:53:15,352 --> 00:53:16,628
{yIghoStaH!}
«Keep moving!»

701
00:53:28,078 --> 00:53:29,258
{yIghoS!}
«Move!»

702
00:53:32,672 --> 00:53:33,760
{yIHu'!}
«Get up!»

703
00:53:34,010 --> 00:53:35,509
{yIghoStaH!}
«Keep moving!»

704
00:54:15,127 --> 00:54:18,379
This is the gulag Rura Penthe.

705
00:54:19,089 --> 00:54:23,092
There is no stockade, no guard tower,

706
00:54:23,844 --> 00:54:26,137
no electronic frontier.

707
00:54:27,139 --> 00:54:30,391
Only a magnetic shield
prevents beaming.

708
00:54:31,060 --> 00:54:36,314
Punishment means exile
from prison to the surface.

709
00:54:37,066 --> 00:54:41,027
On the surface, nothing can survive.

710
00:54:45,658 --> 00:54:49,202
Work well and you will be treated well.

711
00:54:50,329 --> 00:54:53,790
Work badly and you will die.

712
00:54:58,740 --> 00:54:59,776
{yIghoStaH!}
«Keep moving!»

713
00:55:01,426 --> 00:55:02,741
{yIghoStaH!}
«Keep moving!»

714
00:55:04,791 --> 00:55:05,982
{yIghoStaH!}
«Keep moving!»

715
00:55:10,732 --> 00:55:13,002
{yIghoStaH!}
«Keep moving!»

716
00:55:13,252 --> 00:55:23,757
????

717
00:55:24,007 --> 00:55:26,213
{yIghoStaH!}
«Keep moving!»

718
00:55:26,276 --> 00:55:27,168
{yIghoS!}
«Move!»

719
00:55:27,418 --> 00:55:28,789
{yIghoStaH!}
«Keep moving!»

720
00:55:28,839 --> 00:55:30,018
{tugh! tugh!}
«Hurry up! Hurry up!»

721
00:55:30,368 --> 00:55:31,797
{yIghoStaH!}
«Keep moving!»

722
00:55:32,047 --> 00:55:33,547
FIXME: more sentences

723
00:56:20,919 --> 00:56:22,295
Oh, my God.

724
00:56:27,551 --> 00:56:30,970
The universal translator's
been confiscated.

725
00:56:32,806 --> 00:56:34,140
I'm sorry?

726
00:56:38,979 --> 00:56:41,773
He's definitely on about something, Jim.

727
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:49,322
If this is your spot, we'll move on.

728
00:56:49,990 --> 00:56:52,992
He wants your obedience
to the brotherhood of aliens.

729
00:56:53,077 --> 00:56:55,369
- He's got it.
- And your coat.

730
00:56:55,454 --> 00:56:58,164
I'm afraid not. Besides, it wouldn't fit.

731
00:57:13,013 --> 00:57:14,180
Thanks.

732
00:57:14,681 --> 00:57:16,891
This will help keep you warm.

733
00:57:18,685 --> 00:57:21,729
I'm Martia.
You're Kirk and McCoy, I presume.

734
00:57:23,732 --> 00:57:24,857
How'd you know that?

735
00:57:24,942 --> 00:57:27,360
We don't get many
presidential assassins.

736
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:30,071
- We didn't kill Gorkon.
- Of course not,

737
00:57:31,323 --> 00:57:34,784
- but there is a reward for your death.
- It figures.

738
00:57:35,410 --> 00:57:37,453
We've been set up all along.

739
00:57:37,538 --> 00:57:40,373
Somebody up there
wants you out of the way.

740
00:57:46,171 --> 00:57:47,880
- Nothing in here.
- Nothing here.

741
00:57:48,173 --> 00:57:49,632
- Any progress?
- None.

742
00:57:49,716 --> 00:57:52,844
We have a crew of 300
turning their own quarters inside out,

743
00:57:52,928 --> 00:57:55,304
but the killers may still be among them.

744
00:57:55,389 --> 00:57:58,474
Surely they have disposed
of these boots by now.

745
00:57:59,017 --> 00:58:01,978
Would it not have been logical
to have left them on Gorkon's ship?

746
00:58:02,062 --> 00:58:04,480
Even logic must give way to physics.

747
00:58:04,565 --> 00:58:07,150
Gravity had not been restored
by the time they escaped.

748
00:58:07,526 --> 00:58:08,484
Without the boots,

749
00:58:08,569 --> 00:58:11,904
they would have floated off
the Klingon transporter pads.

750
00:58:12,406 --> 00:58:14,532
Why not simply vaporize them?

751
00:58:17,578 --> 00:58:18,953
Like this?

752
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:27,211
At ease.

753
00:58:27,462 --> 00:58:30,965
As you know, Commander Chekov,
no one can fire an unauthorized phaser

754
00:58:31,049 --> 00:58:32,717
aboard a starship.

755
00:58:33,844 --> 00:58:37,847
Suppose when they returned,
they threw the boots into the refuse.

756
00:58:38,223 --> 00:58:42,310
I'm having the refuse searched.
If my surmise is correct,

757
00:58:42,394 --> 00:58:44,353
those boots will cling
to the killers' necks

758
00:58:44,438 --> 00:58:46,606
like a pair of Tiberian bats.

759
00:58:46,982 --> 00:58:48,691
They could not
make their escape without them,

760
00:58:48,775 --> 00:58:51,903
nor can they simply throw them
out the window for all to see.

761
00:58:51,987 --> 00:58:56,324
- Those boots are here somewhere.
- Did someone fire off a phaser?

762
00:58:56,658 --> 00:58:59,493
It's all right. It's nothing. It's nothing.

763
00:59:00,787 --> 00:59:04,457
Mr. Spock, Starfleet is screaming for us
to return to port.

764
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:08,211
- Who fired that...
- Mr. Scott.

765
00:59:08,795 --> 00:59:11,214
I understand you're having difficulty
with the warp drive.

766
00:59:11,298 --> 00:59:13,216
How much time
do you require for repair?

767
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:15,051
There's nothing wrong
with the bloody thing.

768
00:59:15,135 --> 00:59:17,803
Mr. Scott, if we return to spacedock,

769
00:59:18,472 --> 00:59:20,181
the assassins will surely find a way

770
00:59:20,265 --> 00:59:22,516
to dispose
of their incriminating footwear,

771
00:59:22,976 --> 00:59:26,687
and we will never see
the Captain or Dr McCoy alive again.

772
00:59:27,272 --> 00:59:30,107
- It could take weeks, sir.
- Thank you, Mr. Scott.

773
00:59:30,192 --> 00:59:32,401
Valeris, please inform
Starfleet Command

774
00:59:32,486 --> 00:59:35,154
- our warp drive is inoperative.
- A lie?

775
00:59:35,697 --> 00:59:36,989
An error.

776
00:59:37,658 --> 00:59:42,078
You understand we have lost all contact
with the Captain and Dr McCoy.

777
00:59:42,162 --> 00:59:45,331
Yes. At the moment, they're surrounded
by a magnetic shield.

778
00:59:45,415 --> 00:59:49,085
However, if I know the Captain,
by this time,

779
00:59:49,169 --> 00:59:51,671
he is deep into planning his escape.

780
01:00:14,820 --> 01:00:18,072
You got him, Jim!
You got him where you want him!

781
01:01:10,542 --> 01:01:12,626
- You all right, Jim?
- I think so.

782
01:01:12,753 --> 01:01:15,129
- They'll respect you now.
- That's a comfort.

783
01:01:15,213 --> 01:01:18,841
- I was lucky that thing had knees.
- That was not his knee.

784
01:01:19,926 --> 01:01:23,137
Not everybody keeps their genitals
in the same place, Captain.

785
01:01:24,014 --> 01:01:26,223
Anything you want to tell me?

786
01:01:27,476 --> 01:01:29,685
Bones, why don't you see
what you can do for him?

787
01:01:29,770 --> 01:01:32,480
Let him know
we're not holding a grudge.

788
01:01:32,731 --> 01:01:34,940
Suppose he's holding a grudge?

789
01:01:36,610 --> 01:01:41,447
When whoever it is makes their move,
you won't be here to ask if he's the one.

790
01:01:46,495 --> 01:01:50,122
- Do you want to get out of here?
- There's gotta be a way.

791
01:02:11,186 --> 01:02:14,522
Three months before retirement.
What a way to finish.

792
01:02:14,606 --> 01:02:18,234
- We're not finished.
- No? Speak for yourself.

793
01:02:18,944 --> 01:02:22,696
One day, one night, Kobayashi Maru.

794
01:02:22,781 --> 01:02:26,367
Bones, are you afraid of the future?

795
01:02:28,412 --> 01:02:33,249
I believe that was the general idea
that I was trying to convey.

796
01:02:33,333 --> 01:02:35,334
I don't mean this future.

797
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:40,548
- What is this, multiple choice?
- Some people are afraid

798
01:02:42,551 --> 01:02:44,343
of what might happen.

799
01:02:46,096 --> 01:02:47,680
I was terrified.

800
01:02:48,390 --> 01:02:50,724
What terrified you, specifically?

801
01:02:57,107 --> 01:02:58,899
No more neutral zone.

802
01:03:01,236 --> 01:03:03,529
I was used to hating Klingons.

803
01:03:07,451 --> 01:03:10,995
It never even occurred to me
to take Gorkon at his word.

804
01:03:14,207 --> 01:03:15,791
Spock was right.

805
01:03:16,042 --> 01:03:20,004
Try not to be too hard on yourself.
We all felt exactly the same.

806
01:03:20,088 --> 01:03:21,130
No.

807
01:03:22,507 --> 01:03:24,550
Somebody felt a lot worse.

808
01:03:26,303 --> 01:03:28,596
I'm beginning to understand why.

809
01:03:29,181 --> 01:03:32,600
Well, if you've got any bright ideas,
now's the time.

810
01:03:32,726 --> 01:03:35,895
Time's the problem.
You and I are nothing.

811
01:03:37,439 --> 01:03:39,982
But you heard the judge.
The peace conference is on again.

812
01:03:40,066 --> 01:03:44,195
Whoever killed Gorkon is bound
to attempt another assassination.

813
01:03:46,781 --> 01:03:49,033
Unless we can get out of here.

814
01:04:00,212 --> 01:04:02,004
Kirk, it's me, Martia.

815
01:04:02,130 --> 01:04:05,424
Listen, no one has ever escaped
from Rura Penthe.

816
01:04:06,092 --> 01:04:08,511
- Except us.
- It is possible.

817
01:04:09,846 --> 01:04:13,432
- I know how to get outside the shield.
- How do we fit in?

818
01:04:13,517 --> 01:04:15,935
Getting outside the shield is easy,

819
01:04:16,144 --> 01:04:19,772
but after that, it's up to you to get us
off the surface before we freeze.

820
01:04:19,856 --> 01:04:21,106
Can you?

821
01:04:22,275 --> 01:04:25,236
- It's possible.
- I can't make it alone,

822
01:04:26,571 --> 01:04:30,699
and you're likeliest candidate
to come in this hellhole for months.

823
01:04:30,784 --> 01:04:32,535
Candidate for what?

824
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:50,386
Go to lift seven in the morning
for mining duty.

825
01:04:50,470 --> 01:04:53,597
I'll see you there. Don't disappoint me.

826
01:04:56,977 --> 01:05:00,604
- What is it with you, anyway?
- Still think we're finished?

827
01:05:00,897 --> 01:05:02,439
More than ever.

828
01:05:07,654 --> 01:05:09,780
- I'm sorry to wake you, sir.
- What is it?

829
01:05:09,864 --> 01:05:12,074
Starfleet urgently requests
any data we have

830
01:05:12,158 --> 01:05:14,618
on the whereabouts of Enterprise.

831
01:05:17,372 --> 01:05:18,497
What?

832
01:05:18,832 --> 01:05:21,250
Well, apparently, they're refusing
to acknowledge signal

833
01:05:21,334 --> 01:05:23,502
to return to spacedock, sir.

834
01:05:27,007 --> 01:05:31,719
Signal Starfleet that we have no idea
location Enterprise.

835
01:05:32,804 --> 01:05:33,846
Sir?

836
01:05:35,265 --> 01:05:38,183
- You have hearing problems, mister?
- No, sir.

837
01:06:22,646 --> 01:06:23,646
Klingon blood.

838
01:06:24,856 --> 01:06:26,857
They must have walked through it
when it was floating

839
01:06:26,941 --> 01:06:28,942
and tracked it back here.

840
01:06:30,070 --> 01:06:33,155
This is the first evidence
which corroborates our theory.

841
01:06:33,239 --> 01:06:34,490
Now we go to Starfleet.

842
01:06:34,574 --> 01:06:38,202
Now we expand our search
to include uniforms.

843
01:06:39,412 --> 01:06:40,913
All uniforms?

844
01:06:47,629 --> 01:06:49,171
Take those out.

845
01:06:54,844 --> 01:06:57,763
- Continue scanning.
- Nothing, sir.

846
01:07:00,642 --> 01:07:02,017
Clear, sir.

847
01:07:03,687 --> 01:07:05,979
Coming through. Coming through.

848
01:07:07,816 --> 01:07:09,858
Computer well seven clear.

849
01:07:12,696 --> 01:07:14,196
Nothing. Nothing.

850
01:07:14,864 --> 01:07:18,617
Okay, let's see what we got.
Nothing. Nothing so far.

851
01:07:19,077 --> 01:07:20,327
Sir! Sir!

852
01:07:31,877 --> 01:07:33,696
??? {nuq beyIt.}

853
01:07:34,146 --> 01:07:35,793
??? {hepqu jay'.}

854
01:07:38,643 --> 01:07:40,586
??? {hepqu' jay'.}

855
01:07:51,901 --> 01:07:55,112
- I think we've been had.
- No, you weren't, Doctor.

856
01:07:55,822 --> 01:07:59,491
Get off at the first level.
Follow the gang into the mine.

857
01:07:59,993 --> 01:08:01,827
They don't take girls.

858
01:08:12,797 --> 01:08:14,548
You are Crewman Dax?

859
01:08:15,133 --> 01:08:17,634
Yes, Commander. What is the problem?

860
01:08:18,636 --> 01:08:22,848
Perhaps you know
Russian epic of Cinderella?

861
01:08:25,685 --> 01:08:28,729
If shoe fits, wear it.

862
01:08:30,648 --> 01:08:32,024
Mr. Chekov.

863
01:08:47,916 --> 01:08:49,208
Watch me.

864
01:08:52,003 --> 01:08:54,838
What kind of creature is this?
Last night, you two were...

865
01:08:54,923 --> 01:08:56,548
Don't remind me.

866
01:08:59,427 --> 01:09:00,636
Get in.

867
01:09:31,109 --> 01:09:32,309
??? {piju kanta}

868
01:09:34,359 --> 01:09:35,242
??? {shendid.}

869
01:09:35,792 --> 01:09:38,325
??? {gande. -- gande. -- gande.}

870
01:09:38,775 --> 01:09:40,488
??? {toH!}

871
01:10:11,833 --> 01:10:14,459
Come on. We don't have a lot of time.

872
01:10:32,145 --> 01:10:33,312
Hurry.

873
01:10:37,483 --> 01:10:38,734
Up there.

874
01:10:41,321 --> 01:10:42,863
Come on, climb.

875
01:10:54,292 --> 01:10:56,668
Here. You'll need these. Quickly!

876
01:11:18,316 --> 01:11:19,691
Stay close.

877
01:12:36,769 --> 01:12:37,728
There they are.

878
01:12:37,812 --> 01:12:40,188
They're emerging
from the beaming shield.

879
01:12:40,273 --> 01:12:42,733
- Mr. Scott, start your engines.
- Aye, aye, sir.

880
01:12:42,817 --> 01:12:45,527
Mr. Chekov, set course for Rura Penthe.

881
01:12:45,611 --> 01:12:49,322
Mr. Spock, Rura Penthe
is deep inside the Klingon frontier.

882
01:12:49,782 --> 01:12:52,242
- If we are discovered...
- Quite correct, Mr. Chekov.

883
01:12:52,326 --> 01:12:55,078
What is required now
is a feat of linguistic legerdemain

884
01:12:55,580 --> 01:12:57,164
and a degree of intrepidity

885
01:12:57,248 --> 01:12:59,833
before the Captain and Dr McCoy
freeze to death.

886
01:13:07,341 --> 01:13:09,551
- Leave me. I'm finished.
- No!

887
01:13:11,054 --> 01:13:15,098
Bones, I'm wearing a viridium patch
on my back.

888
01:13:15,475 --> 01:13:19,186
Spock slapped it there
just before we went on Gorkon's ship.

889
01:13:19,645 --> 01:13:24,775
- Why, that cunning little Vulcan.
- Come on. We're in the clear.

890
01:13:26,694 --> 01:13:28,403
Now that we're outside the shield,

891
01:13:28,488 --> 01:13:31,156
they'll be able to locate us
two sectors away.

892
01:13:31,657 --> 01:13:33,492
If they're even looking for us.

893
01:14:02,756 --> 01:14:05,982
This is listening post Morska.
{Morski ge.}

894
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:09,428
What ship is that? Over.
{Dujvets 'oh nuq? rIn.}

01:14:11,278 --> 01:14:14,314

01:14:17,264 --> 01:14:19,797
{Dujvets 'oh nuq? rIn.}

897
01:14:21,207 --> 01:14:22,791
We must respond personally.
- {Dujvets 'oh nuq? rIn.}

898
01:14:22,875 --> 01:14:25,627
A universal translator
would be recognized.

899
01:14:25,447 --> 01:14:27,946
{Dujvets 'oh nuq? rIn.}

900
01:14:28,496 --> 01:14:31,680
{Dujvets 'oh nuq? rIn.}

01:14:33,820 --> 01:14:37,514
We am thy freighter Ursva.
{tongDuj 'urISva' maH.}

902
01:14:38,408 --> 01:14:44,629
Six weeks out of Kronos.

906
01:14:58,870 --> 01:15:00,996
What is your destination? Over.

01:15:02,746 --> 01:15:05,173
{rura' pente'Daq}

908
01:15:05,618 --> 01:15:14,634

909
01:15:18,198 --> 01:15:21,467
Don't catch any bugs!
{ghewmey SuqQo'!}

910
01:15:53,299 --> 01:15:56,551
Would you mind explaining
that little trick you do?

911
01:15:57,470 --> 01:16:00,347
- I'm a chameloid.
- I've heard about you.

912
01:16:02,016 --> 01:16:03,558
Shapeshifters.

913
01:16:05,436 --> 01:16:09,231
- I thought you were mythical.
- Give a girl a chance, Captain.

914
01:16:11,484 --> 01:16:15,070
- It takes a lot of effort.
- I don't doubt it.

915
01:16:16,656 --> 01:16:18,448
Stop me if I'm wrong,

916
01:16:18,866 --> 01:16:22,786
but do we have any way of knowing
whether this is the real you?

917
01:16:23,287 --> 01:16:26,081
I thought I would assume
a pleasing shape.

918
01:16:33,005 --> 01:16:36,424
We're outside the shield.
Now it's your turn, Captain.

919
01:16:37,468 --> 01:16:38,969
If you say so.

920
01:16:41,013 --> 01:16:42,514
Are you crazy?

921
01:16:42,682 --> 01:16:44,182
She didn't need our help
getting anywhere.

922
01:16:44,267 --> 01:16:46,101
Where'd you get
these convenient clothes?

923
01:16:46,185 --> 01:16:49,062
Don't tell me that flare
is standard prison issue.

924
01:16:49,522 --> 01:16:53,525
It's to let them know where we are.
Ask her what she's getting in return.

925
01:16:53,609 --> 01:16:55,110
A full pardon,

926
01:16:56,362 --> 01:16:58,154
which doesn't cover this.

927
01:16:58,239 --> 01:17:01,324
An accident wasn't good enough.
Come on, Spock.

928
01:17:02,034 --> 01:17:05,453
Good enough for one.
Two would have looked suspicious.

929
01:17:06,539 --> 01:17:11,167
Killed while attempting escape.
Now that's convincing for both.

930
01:17:15,881 --> 01:17:17,132
Surprise!

931
01:17:29,145 --> 01:17:31,980
- Your friends are late.
- They'll be along.

932
01:17:35,526 --> 01:17:39,779
- I can't believe I kissed you.
- Must have been your lifelong ambition.

933
01:17:55,338 --> 01:17:57,672
Isn't it about time
you became something else?

934
01:17:57,757 --> 01:17:59,299
I like it here.

935
01:18:08,392 --> 01:18:11,644
Well, well, well.

936
01:18:19,445 --> 01:18:21,279
What took you so long?

937
01:18:22,698 --> 01:18:26,451
- Kill him. He's the one.
- Not me, you idiot. Him!

938
01:18:29,330 --> 01:18:32,624
- No witnesses.
- Killed while trying to escape.

939
01:18:33,793 --> 01:18:36,753
- Damn clever, if you ask me.
- It's a classic.

940
01:18:37,129 --> 01:18:40,423
- That's what he wanted.
- Who? Who wanted us killed?

941
01:18:41,050 --> 01:18:44,969
Since you're all going to die anyway,
why not tell you?

942
01:18:45,513 --> 01:18:47,013
His name is...

943
01:18:53,437 --> 01:18:57,607
Damn it to hell! Of all the... Son of a...

944
01:18:57,942 --> 01:19:00,068
- Couldn't you have waited two seconds?
- Captain?

945
01:19:00,152 --> 01:19:02,278
He was just about to explain
the whole thing.

946
01:19:02,363 --> 01:19:03,655
You want to go back?

947
01:19:03,739 --> 01:19:06,241
- Absolutely not!
- It's cold.

948
01:19:07,827 --> 01:19:10,745
This is the Bridge.
We are still in Klingon space.

949
01:19:10,830 --> 01:19:15,875
Deck 9, remain at battle stations.
Deck 9, remain at battle stations.

950
01:19:49,235 --> 01:19:51,211
They were beamed aboard a Federation starship.
{... Qollu'ta'.}
«The were beamed away.»

951
01:19:51,763 --> 01:19:53,464
I could trace...
{qaghochnISlaH...}
«I could trace for you...»

952
01:19:53,714 --> 01:19:54,965
{narghta'.}
«They have escaped.»

953
01:19:59,705 --> 01:20:03,089
Escaped.
{narghta'.}

954
01:20:04,200 --> 01:20:08,970
Kirk cannot know the location
of the peace conference.
{qay'be'. Daq SovlaHbe'taH qIrq.}

955
01:20:09,664 --> 01:20:12,190
Are you sure?
{DaSovbej'a'?}

956
01:20:12,458 --> 01:20:15,294
Will you take that chance?
{bISuDrup'a'?}

957
01:20:16,244 --> 01:20:17,962
{DeghwI'.} «Helmsman!»
- {qaH.} «Sir!»

958
01:20:17,271 --> 01:20:20,440
Helmsman, make course to intercept Enterprise.
{‹He chu'›. So'wI' yIchu'.}
- {qaH.}

959
01:20:26,864 --> 01:20:28,031
The Klingons have a new weapon,

960
01:20:28,115 --> 01:20:30,033
a bird-of-prey that can fire
when cloaked.

961
01:20:30,117 --> 01:20:32,368
- She torpedoed Gorkon's ship.
- So that's it.

962
01:20:32,453 --> 01:20:35,079
Not entirely. I have reason to believe
that Gorkon's murderers

963
01:20:35,164 --> 01:20:37,916
- are aboard this vessel.
- I have a thought about that.

964
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:39,375
Has the peace conference begun?

965
01:20:39,460 --> 01:20:41,252
Who knows?
They're keeping the location secret.

966
01:20:41,337 --> 01:20:43,171
- There's always something.
- Captain!

967
01:20:43,589 --> 01:20:48,051
Mr. Spock! I found the missing uniforms
with the Klingon blood on them.

968
01:21:03,442 --> 01:21:06,903
But the uniforms belong
to these two men,

969
01:21:06,987 --> 01:21:09,239
Burke and Samno.

970
01:21:09,657 --> 01:21:13,243
Not anymore.
Phaser on stun at close range.

971
01:21:13,327 --> 01:21:16,538
First rule of assassination,
kill the assassins.

972
01:21:17,581 --> 01:21:20,792
- Now we're back to square one.
- Can I talk to you?

973
01:21:23,546 --> 01:21:26,047
I wonder why they weren't vaporized.

974
01:21:27,091 --> 01:21:29,175
It would set off the alarm.

975
01:21:36,308 --> 01:21:37,809
It's possible.

976
01:21:38,519 --> 01:21:43,982
Now hear this. Now hear this.
Court reporter to sickbay.

977
01:21:44,191 --> 01:21:48,152
Code Blue. Urgent.
Statements to be taken at once

978
01:21:48,237 --> 01:21:53,449
from yeomen Burke and Samno.
Repeat. Court reporter to sickbay.

979
01:21:53,534 --> 01:21:56,786
Code Blue. Urgent.
Statements to be taken.

980
01:21:57,788 --> 01:22:01,833
Repeat. Statements to be taken
from yeomen Burke and Samno.

981
01:22:40,873 --> 01:22:42,540
You have to shoot.

982
01:22:46,378 --> 01:22:50,381
If you are logical, you have to shoot.

983
01:22:55,179 --> 01:22:56,471
I do not want to.

984
01:22:56,555 --> 01:23:00,224
What you want is irrelevant.
What you've chosen is at hand.

985
01:23:01,352 --> 01:23:03,519
I'd just as soon you didn't.

986
01:23:11,111 --> 01:23:12,987
The operation is over.

987
01:23:19,203 --> 01:23:22,580
I did not fire. You cannot prove anything.

988
01:23:22,873 --> 01:23:27,502
Yes, I can. At my trial,
my personal log was used against me.

989
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:31,839
How long did you wait outside
my quarters before I noticed you?

990
01:23:33,759 --> 01:23:35,051
You knew?

991
01:23:37,304 --> 01:23:40,306
I tried to tell you,
but you would not listen.

992
01:23:41,350 --> 01:23:44,477
Neither of us was hearing
very well that night, Lieutenant.

993
01:23:44,561 --> 01:23:48,106
There were things I tried to tell you
about having faith.

994
01:23:48,357 --> 01:23:50,775
You have betrayed the Federation.

995
01:23:51,777 --> 01:23:53,152
All of you.

996
01:23:53,362 --> 01:23:55,029
And what do you think
you've been doing?

997
01:23:55,114 --> 01:23:58,741
Saving Starfleet.
Klingons cannot be trusted.

998
01:23:59,952 --> 01:24:01,035
Sir.

999
01:24:02,287 --> 01:24:05,456
You said so yourself.
They killed your son.

1000
01:24:06,166 --> 01:24:09,460
Did you not wish Gorkon dead?
"Let them die," you said.

1001
01:24:09,545 --> 01:24:11,462
Did I misinterpret you?

1002
01:24:14,341 --> 01:24:16,092
And you were right.

1003
01:24:17,010 --> 01:24:20,722
They conspired with us
to assassinate their own chancellor.

1004
01:24:20,806 --> 01:24:22,974
How trustworthy can they be?

1005
01:24:23,434 --> 01:24:27,061
Klingons and Federation members
conspiring together?

1006
01:24:27,604 --> 01:24:28,896
Who is "us"?

1007
01:24:28,981 --> 01:24:31,649
Everyone who stands
to lose from peace.

1008
01:24:32,151 --> 01:24:35,903
- Names, Lieutenant.
- My comrades will make certain

1009
01:24:35,988 --> 01:24:39,240
all your ship-to-shore transmissions
are jammed.

1010
01:24:39,324 --> 01:24:40,992
Names, Lieutenant.

1011
01:24:41,493 --> 01:24:43,703
I do not remember.

1012
01:24:46,832 --> 01:24:47,999
A lie?

1013
01:24:49,960 --> 01:24:51,210
A choice.

1014
01:24:55,966 --> 01:24:57,133
Spock?

1015
01:25:41,512 --> 01:25:44,472
Admiral Cartwright.

1016
01:25:45,724 --> 01:25:47,225
From Starfleet?

1017
01:25:55,234 --> 01:25:56,484
Who else?

1018
01:26:01,323 --> 01:26:03,199
- General...
- General...

1019
01:26:04,409 --> 01:26:05,910
- ...Chang.
- ...Chang.

1020
01:26:11,750 --> 01:26:13,251
Who else?

1021
01:26:13,794 --> 01:26:15,670
- Romulan...
- Romulan...

1022
01:26:15,754 --> 01:26:17,505
- ...Ambassador...
- ...Ambassador...

1023
01:26:17,589 --> 01:26:19,257
- ...Nanclus.
- ...Nanclus.

1024
01:26:23,095 --> 01:26:25,346
Where is the peace conference?

1025
01:26:27,599 --> 01:26:29,851
Where is the peace conference?

1026
01:27:03,802 --> 01:27:05,428
She does not know.

1027
01:27:07,890 --> 01:27:09,473
Then we're dead.

1028
01:27:20,068 --> 01:27:23,321
I've been dead before.
Contact Excelsior.

1029
01:27:25,198 --> 01:27:28,784
- She'll have the coordinates.
- I've already got him, sir.

1030
01:27:29,912 --> 01:27:31,412
Standing by, Captain Kirk.

1031
01:27:31,496 --> 01:27:32,580
Sulu!

1032
01:27:32,998 --> 01:27:37,209
You realize that by even talking to us,
you're violating regulations.

1033
01:27:37,336 --> 01:27:40,171
I'm sorry, Captain.
Your message is breaking up.

1034
01:27:40,255 --> 01:27:43,341
Bless you, Sulu.
Where is the peace conference?

1035
01:27:44,176 --> 01:27:46,135
They're going to attempt
another assassination.

1036
01:27:46,219 --> 01:27:49,972
The conference is at Camp Khitomer,
near the Romulan border.

1037
01:27:50,974 --> 01:27:54,268
I'm sending the exact coordinates
on a coded frequency.

1038
01:27:54,353 --> 01:27:56,354
I'm afraid
we're gonna need more than that.

1039
01:27:56,438 --> 01:27:58,981
There's a bird-of-prey
on the lookout for us,

1040
01:27:59,066 --> 01:28:00,608
and she can fire while cloaked.

1041
01:28:00,692 --> 01:28:02,109
Surely not.

1042
01:28:02,194 --> 01:28:05,071
Hold on.
How many of those things are there?

1043
01:28:05,489 --> 01:28:07,239
Come on, Lieutenant.

1044
01:28:07,866 --> 01:28:10,576
- Just the prototype.
- You hear that?

1045
01:28:11,203 --> 01:28:14,789
I'm getting underway now,
but we're now in Alpha Quadrant.

1046
01:28:14,873 --> 01:28:18,250
The chances of our reaching
the conference in time are slim.

1047
01:28:18,335 --> 01:28:20,670
When does this conference start?

1048
01:28:20,754 --> 01:28:23,255
According to my information, today.

1049
01:28:24,591 --> 01:28:26,384
Thank you, Captain Sulu.

1050
01:28:26,593 --> 01:28:28,094
Don't mention it, Captain Kirk.

1051
01:28:34,893 --> 01:28:36,060
Spock?

1052
01:28:37,479 --> 01:28:39,105
I prefer it dark.

1053
01:28:46,405 --> 01:28:47,989
Dining on ashes?

1054
01:28:48,949 --> 01:28:50,491
You were right.

1055
01:28:50,909 --> 01:28:56,330
It was arrogant presumption on my part
that got us into this situation.

1056
01:28:58,250 --> 01:29:01,085
You and the doctor
might have been killed.

1057
01:29:01,753 --> 01:29:03,504
The night is young.

1058
01:29:04,423 --> 01:29:08,926
You said it yourself. It was logical.
Peace is worth a few personal risks.

1059
01:29:12,889 --> 01:29:15,016
You're a great one for logic.

1060
01:29:15,100 --> 01:29:18,728
I'm a great one for rushing in
where angels fear to tread.

1061
01:29:20,397 --> 01:29:22,273
We're both extremists.

1062
01:29:22,649 --> 01:29:25,693
Reality is probably
somewhere in between.

1063
01:29:30,782 --> 01:29:33,534
I couldn't get past the death of my son.

1064
01:29:33,952 --> 01:29:37,997
I was prejudiced
by her accomplishments as a Vulcan.

1065
01:29:39,124 --> 01:29:42,793
Gorkon had to die before I understood
how prejudiced I was.

1066
01:29:50,677 --> 01:29:55,097
Is it possible that we two, you and I,

1067
01:29:56,058 --> 01:30:00,394
have grown so old and so inflexible

1068
01:30:01,313 --> 01:30:03,898
that we have outlived our usefulness?

1069
01:30:06,151 --> 01:30:08,694
Would that constitute a joke?

1070
01:30:10,197 --> 01:30:12,406
Don't crucify yourself.
It wasn't your fault.

1071
01:30:12,491 --> 01:30:14,158
I was responsible.

1072
01:30:15,535 --> 01:30:19,872
- For no actions but your own.
- That is not what you said at your trial.

1073
01:30:21,166 --> 01:30:23,417
That was as captain of the ship.
Human beings...

1074
01:30:23,502 --> 01:30:26,796
But, Captain, we both know
that I am not human.

1075
01:30:27,297 --> 01:30:30,674
Spock, you want to know something?
Everybody's human.

1076
01:30:31,718 --> 01:30:34,845
I find that remark insulting.

1077
01:30:36,264 --> 01:30:37,431
Come on. I need you.

1078
01:30:41,978 --> 01:30:43,604
Madam Chancellor,

1079
01:30:44,481 --> 01:30:48,692
members of the Diplomatic Corps,
honored guests,

1080
01:30:50,362 --> 01:30:54,281
the United Federation of Planets
welcomes you to Camp Khitomer.

1081
01:31:11,508 --> 01:31:13,759
She's out here somewhere.

1082
01:31:14,219 --> 01:31:16,178
But if she is cloaked...

1083
01:31:16,805 --> 01:31:18,973
Then all we have
is a neutron radiation surge,

1084
01:31:19,057 --> 01:31:22,143
and by the time we're close enough
to record it, we're ashes.

1085
01:31:22,227 --> 01:31:23,644
209.

1086
01:31:26,648 --> 01:31:27,857
206.

1087
01:31:31,486 --> 01:31:32,987
203.

1088
01:31:34,614 --> 01:31:39,326
- Close enough to beam down?
- Not yet, Captain. In two minutes. 158.

1089
01:31:41,371 --> 01:31:44,498
- Go to impulse power for Khitomer orbit.
- Aye, sir.

1090
01:31:53,300 --> 01:31:58,637
Let us redefine progress to mean
that just because we can do a thing,

1091
01:31:58,722 --> 01:32:03,142
it does not necessarily follow
that we must do that thing.

1092
01:32:06,938 --> 01:32:09,023
- Uhura?
- Nothing, Captain.

1093
01:32:09,774 --> 01:32:12,818
If she's here,
she's rigged for silent running.

1094
01:32:19,701 --> 01:32:22,786
Coming up on transporter range
in 57 seconds.

1095
01:32:23,788 --> 01:32:26,457
Transporter Room,
stand by to beam down.

1096
01:32:29,628 --> 01:32:30,669
...53...

1097
01:32:35,508 --> 01:32:36,884
...48 seconds.

1098
01:32:42,390 --> 01:32:43,432
...44...

1099
01:32:46,728 --> 01:32:48,562
I can see you, Kirk.

1100
01:32:50,482 --> 01:32:51,649
Chang.

1101
01:32:52,817 --> 01:32:54,360
Can you see me?

1102
01:32:55,528 --> 01:32:59,573
Now, be honest, Captain.
Warrior to warrior,

1103
01:33:00,367 --> 01:33:04,119
you do prefer it this way, don't you?
As it was meant to be.

1104
01:33:04,871 --> 01:33:07,039
No peace in our time.

1105
01:33:07,749 --> 01:33:12,503
"Once more unto the breach,
dear friends."

1106
01:33:16,453 --> 01:33:19,834
{taH pagh taHbe'.}

1107
01:33:28,520 --> 01:33:31,772
- This is fun.
- Reverse engines. All astern.

1108
01:33:31,856 --> 01:33:35,025
One and a half impulse power.
Back off! Back off!

1109
01:33:38,264 --> 01:33:41,031
What's she doing?
{qatlh pa' ghoS?}
«Why is she going there?»

1110
01:33:41,825 --> 01:33:43,701
What's she waiting for?

1111
01:33:44,703 --> 01:33:48,122
Probably attempting to ascertain
why we are reversing,

1112
01:33:48,540 --> 01:33:50,874
wondering whether we detect her.

1113
01:33:56,214 --> 01:33:57,464
Incoming!

1114
01:34:01,886 --> 01:34:04,471
- In range?
- Not yet, sir.

1115
01:34:04,556 --> 01:34:05,973
Come on. Come on.

1116
01:34:06,057 --> 01:34:08,058
- She'll fly apart.
- Fly her apart, then!

1117
01:34:08,643 --> 01:34:12,438
Many speculated
about my father's motives.

1118
01:34:13,732 --> 01:34:16,692
There were those who said
he was an idealist.

1119
01:34:16,860 --> 01:34:19,069
Others said he had no choice.

1120
01:34:19,654 --> 01:34:23,407
If Praxis had not exploded,
then quite possibly his idealism

1121
01:34:23,658 --> 01:34:28,203
would not have found expression.
We are a proud race,

1122
01:34:28,788 --> 01:34:33,500
and we are here because
we intend to go on being proud.

1123
01:34:43,386 --> 01:34:47,431
- Go to auxiliary power!
- Auxiliary circuits destroyed, Captain.

1124
01:34:53,438 --> 01:34:57,441
"Tickle us, do we not laugh?
Prick us, do we not bleed?

1125
01:34:58,109 --> 01:34:59,443
"Wrong us,

1126
01:35:00,737 --> 01:35:02,529
"shall we not revenge?"

1127
01:35:03,490 --> 01:35:04,573
Gas.

1128
01:35:06,493 --> 01:35:10,996
Gas, Captain. Under impulse power,
she expends fuel like any other vessel.

1129
01:35:11,331 --> 01:35:14,041
We call it plasma,
but whatever the Klingon designation,

1130
01:35:14,125 --> 01:35:16,377
it is merely ionized gas.

1131
01:35:17,087 --> 01:35:19,713
Well, what about all
of that equipment we're carrying

1132
01:35:19,798 --> 01:35:21,965
to catalogue gaseous anomalies?

1133
01:35:24,260 --> 01:35:28,889
- Well, the thing's gotta have a tailpipe.
- Doctor, would you care to assist me

1134
01:35:28,973 --> 01:35:32,309
- in performing surgery on a torpedo?
- Fascinating.

1135
01:35:34,187 --> 01:35:35,854
Hard to starboard!

1136
01:35:37,774 --> 01:35:42,277
The proposed agenda is as follows.
The total evacuation of Kronos

1137
01:35:42,362 --> 01:35:46,115
has been calculated
within the 50-Earth-year time span.

1138
01:35:46,199 --> 01:35:48,700
Phase one, preparation for evacuation.

1139
01:35:55,500 --> 01:35:57,167
Come on, reach up!

1140
01:35:59,003 --> 01:36:02,965
Captain! She's packing quite a wallop!
Shields weakening!

1141
01:36:10,849 --> 01:36:12,850
Shields up. All right.

1142
01:36:12,934 --> 01:36:14,852
Now we've given them
something else to shoot at.

1143
01:36:14,936 --> 01:36:16,186
Aye, sir.

1144
01:36:22,861 --> 01:36:24,736
The game's afoot, huh?

1145
01:36:33,037 --> 01:36:37,040
- Excelsior's been hit.
- "Our revels now are ended," Kirk.

1146
01:36:45,967 --> 01:36:50,888
"Cry 'Havoc!'
and let slip the dogs of war."

1147
01:36:52,015 --> 01:36:54,057
Bones, where's my torpedo?

1148
01:36:54,142 --> 01:36:55,809
Bet you wish you'd stood in bed.

1149
01:36:55,894 --> 01:36:57,978
Emergency power!
Gravity control down!

1150
01:36:58,062 --> 01:36:59,771
Shields collapsing!

1151
01:37:02,066 --> 01:37:04,193
The key, please, Doctor. Time is short.

1152
01:37:12,994 --> 01:37:14,411
The hull has been compromised.

1153
01:37:14,496 --> 01:37:17,080
- I wonder how bad?
- Connect echobars.

1154
01:37:17,207 --> 01:37:19,791
...to discuss the report on phase two.

1155
01:37:20,084 --> 01:37:22,920
- Alter circuit "A."
- Sensor.

1156
01:37:23,254 --> 01:37:26,173
I propose that we commence
with the minutes of the preparation.

1157
01:37:26,466 --> 01:37:29,176
"I am constant as the northern star."

1158
01:37:29,260 --> 01:37:31,803
I'd give real money if he'd shut up.

1159
01:37:31,930 --> 01:37:33,222
- Plate, please.
- Plate.

1160
01:37:33,306 --> 01:37:35,057
...and assimilation will consume...

1161
01:37:35,141 --> 01:37:37,017
We've got a heartbeat.

1162
01:37:38,186 --> 01:37:40,187
The Klingon empire, the ecological...

1163
01:37:40,480 --> 01:37:42,064
- Key, please.
- Key.

1164
01:37:42,148 --> 01:37:43,565
Where's that damn torpedo?

1165
01:37:43,650 --> 01:37:45,984
She's ready, Jim. Lock and load.

1166
01:37:48,613 --> 01:37:49,738
Fire.

1167
01:38:02,585 --> 01:38:03,794
To be,

1168
01:38:04,420 --> 01:38:05,671
or not

1169
01:38:06,506 --> 01:38:07,798
to be.

1170
01:38:09,551 --> 01:38:11,635
Target that explosion and fire.

1171
01:38:13,596 --> 01:38:14,596
Fire.

1172
01:38:25,316 --> 01:38:27,401
As I imagine this work will occupy us

1173
01:38:27,485 --> 01:38:30,362
throughout most of the week,
it would be my hope

1174
01:38:30,446 --> 01:38:32,864
that the delegation
could return to their capitals

1175
01:38:32,949 --> 01:38:35,367
to implement the provisions
of phase one,

1176
01:38:35,451 --> 01:38:37,703
no later than the first of next month.

1177
01:38:37,787 --> 01:38:38,787
Scotty.

1178
01:38:38,871 --> 01:38:41,373
As you know, time is of the essence.

1179
01:38:42,333 --> 01:38:44,668
- Out of the way!
- Out of the way!

1180
01:38:46,087 --> 01:38:47,588
Mr. President!

1181
01:38:49,507 --> 01:38:51,717
Mr. President! Mr. President!

1182
01:38:52,677 --> 01:38:54,177
Mr. President!

1183
01:38:56,306 --> 01:38:57,931
Kirk, Enterprise.

1184
01:38:57,881 --> 01:38:58,624
{ghowuv!}
«Rely on us!»

1185
01:38:58,874 --> 01:39:00,330
FIXME - 2 lines

1186
01:39:00,401 --> 01:39:01,602
Protect the Chancellor!
{Qang yIQan!}

1187
01:39:09,068 --> 01:39:11,570
- Arrest those men!
- Arrest yourself.

1188
01:39:16,826 --> 01:39:18,952
We've got a full confession.

1189
01:39:34,052 --> 01:39:36,053
Cartwright, just a minute.

1190
01:39:38,389 --> 01:39:41,683
What's happened?
What's the meaning of all of this?

1191
01:39:42,143 --> 01:39:44,895
It's about the future, Madam Chancellor.

1192
01:39:45,188 --> 01:39:48,315
Some people think the future
means the end of history.

1193
01:39:48,399 --> 01:39:52,402
Well, we haven't run out
of history quite yet.

1194
01:39:54,906 --> 01:39:58,075
Your father called the future

1195
01:39:59,243 --> 01:40:01,244
the undiscovered country.

1196
01:40:04,749 --> 01:40:07,417
People can be very frightened
of change.

1197
01:40:12,423 --> 01:40:14,883
You've restored my father's faith.

1198
01:40:15,802 --> 01:40:18,011
And you've restored my son's.

1199
01:41:06,894 --> 01:41:09,730
Once again, we've saved civilization
as we know it.

1200
01:41:09,814 --> 01:41:12,274
And the good news is,
they're not going to prosecute.

1201
01:41:12,358 --> 01:41:16,236
They might as well have prosecuted me.
I felt like Lieutenant Valeris.

1202
01:41:16,320 --> 01:41:19,197
Well, they don't arrest people
for having feelings.

1203
01:41:19,282 --> 01:41:23,869
And it's a good thing, too. If they did,
we'd all have to turn ourselves in.

1204
01:41:25,997 --> 01:41:27,456
Captain Kirk.

1205
01:41:27,999 --> 01:41:29,458
Captain Sulu.

1206
01:41:30,418 --> 01:41:34,129
As much to the crew of the Enterprise,
I owe you my thanks.

1207
01:41:34,797 --> 01:41:38,216
Nice to see you in action
one more time, Captain Kirk.

1208
01:41:38,801 --> 01:41:40,135
Take care.

1209
01:41:52,273 --> 01:41:54,357
By God, that's a big ship.

1210
01:41:54,817 --> 01:42:00,781
- Not so big as her captain, I think.
- So, this is goodbye.

1211
01:42:02,325 --> 01:42:05,285
I think it's about time
we got underway ourselves.

1212
01:42:05,369 --> 01:42:08,747
Captain, I have orders
from Starfleet Command.

1213
01:42:08,831 --> 01:42:11,541
We're to put back
to spacedock immediately

1214
01:42:11,626 --> 01:42:13,418
to be decommissioned.

1215
01:42:28,601 --> 01:42:30,227
If I were human,

1216
01:42:30,895 --> 01:42:33,230
I believe my response would be,

1217
01:42:34,440 --> 01:42:35,899
"Go to hell."

1218
01:42:39,695 --> 01:42:41,279
If I were human.

1219
01:42:45,660 --> 01:42:47,619
Course heading, Captain?

1220
01:42:53,835 --> 01:42:55,919
Second star to the right,

1221
01:42:57,755 --> 01:42:59,881
and straight on till morning.

1222
01:43:17,316 --> 01:43:20,402
Captain's Log, Stardate 9529.1.

1223
01:43:21,404 --> 01:43:23,947
This is the final cruise
of the Starship Enterprise

1224
01:43:24,031 --> 01:43:25,532
under my command.

1225
01:43:25,825 --> 01:43:31,037
This ship and her history will shortly
become the care of another crew.

1226
01:43:31,122 --> 01:43:34,541
To them and their posterity
will we commit our future.

1227
01:43:35,167 --> 01:43:37,669
They will continue the voyages
we have begun,

1228
01:43:37,753 --> 01:43:40,213
and journey to all
the undiscovered countries,

1229
01:43:40,298 --> 01:43:42,465
boldly going where no man...

1230
01:43:43,259 --> 01:43:44,801
Where no one

1231
01:43:45,391 --> 01:43:46,971
has gone before.
